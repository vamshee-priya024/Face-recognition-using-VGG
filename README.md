Face recognition ,nowadays is an essential and trending method and most widely used technique in most of the all the electronic devices.I have also tried this implementation using VGG which has given very good results.Dataset of any number of people can be selected and the complete dataset is divided into three parts namely, training, testing and validation and then train the model .Here VGG is used as the base model and then our layers of neurons are added .
